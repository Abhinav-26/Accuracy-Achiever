# Accuracy-Achiever : MLOps
In this repository I have uploaded python code which I have used for my setup of accuracy achiever. In this setup I have tried to create an environment such that It will automatically train my model and it will train utill it gets the desired accuarcy. For this setup I used DevOps tools. I have integrated DeepLearning model with DevOps tools like docker and jenkins.<br>

In this Project I have created a docker image with deepLearning libraries like tensorflow2.0, scikit-learn, keras, etc and uploaded the image in my <a href="https://hub.docker.com/u/alex43">DockerHub Profile</a>. I have created two images named <b>alex43/ubuntu-tensorflow2.0</b> and <b>alex43/ubuntu-deeplearning-env</b>. For this Project I have used the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/alex43/ubuntu-deeplearning-env">deeplearning-env image</a>.<br>

To Download the image in your system write the command given below :<br>
<code>docker pull alex43/ubuntu-deeplearning-env</code>
